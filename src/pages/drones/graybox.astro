  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">GrayBox: The Ultimate Solution for Drone Security and After-Action Reporting</h1>
  
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Mission-Critical Data Integrity & Forensic Analysis</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    GrayBox is the black box for drones. It extends traditional flight-data recording with kernel-level protection and encrypted Merkle-tree storage, delivering tamper-proof logs and an integrated after-action report (AAR) system that captures every file access, GPU task, and camera interaction from launch to landing.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why It Matters: After-Action Reporting in Mission-Critical Environments</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    In defense and other high-risk settings, post-mission analysis is vital for accountability, anomaly detection, and mission success. GrayBox automatically produces complete, cryptographically verified audit trails for both military and commercial drone operators.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">These reports provide insights into:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>Every file accessed on the drone, including model files, system libraries, and logs</li>
    <li>GPU task interactions, confirming that AI models and inferences remain unaltered</li>
    <li>Camera usage, showing which camera was accessed, when, and by which process</li>
    <li>Network traffic, showing which ports and IP's were accessed over the network</li>
    <li>Mounting of filesystems, like USB drives, SD cards, and external hard drives</li>
    <li>Real-time tamper alerts that flag deviations from expected behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Comprehensive After-Action Reports with Merkle-Tree Integrity</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    GrayBox records all onboard activity and, after the mission, stores it in an encrypted Merkle-tree database. Each event is signed, time-stamped, and cryptographically protected, creating an immutable chain of custody. Once the drone reconnects, the system syncs with central servers, ensuring that all data is securely transmitted and up-to-date.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Key Features of After-Action Reporting with GrayBox</h2>
  
  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">1. Automated Generation of AARs</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
      <li>Detailed reports are generated automatically, covering every kernel-level event.</li>
      <li>Real-time alerts trigger post-mission investigations of tampered files, unauthorized camera usage, or rogue processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">2. Tamper-Proof Integrity</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
      <li>Offline encrypted Merkle-tree storage protects data in disconnected or hostile environments.</li>
      <li>TPM-backed encryption guarantees logs cannot be altered, preserving legal and compliance value.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">3. Comprehensive Forensic Insights</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
      <li>Reports reveal who accessed the GPU, triggered file writes, or activated sensors—and for how long.</li>
      <li>This depth supports incident investigations, vulnerability assessments, and root-cause analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">4. Data Verification</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-2">
      <li>Every AAR includes a cryptographically verified hash, offering indisputable proof of authenticity.</li>
      <li>TPM sealing ensures data remains untampered and verifiable indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How GrayBox Enhances After-Action Reporting for Drones</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Full Accountability:</strong> Each action—file access, camera usage, and more—is logged and presented in a tamper-proof report.</li>
    <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Operators can review mission logs alongside any unauthorized access or tampering attempts.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Storage & Sync:</strong> Encrypted logs are stored offline and automatically synced when connectivity returns, ensuring up-to-date records even in remote locations.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="my-8">

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Deployment Scenarios for After-Action Reports</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Defense Operations:</strong> Provides a complete chain of evidence for mission-critical flights, covering everything from AI model updates to sensor data collection.</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial Drones:</strong> Enables regulatory compliance, data security, and validation of sensitive data for inspections, deliveries, or surveillance.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-Driven Operations:</strong> Details how onboard models were used, whether they were modified during flight, and if any model poisoning occurred.</li>
  </ul>
