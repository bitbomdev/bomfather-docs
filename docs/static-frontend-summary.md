# Bomfather Static Frontend Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of our recommended approach for creating a static frontend for the Bomfather project. This frontend will serve as the public face of the project, communicating its value proposition, features, and technical capabilities to potential users and contributors.

## Understanding Bomfather in Depth

Bomfather is an eBPF-based kernel-level monitoring framework that provides accurate identification of dependencies in software supply chains. It addresses critical shortcomings in traditional SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation methods by:

1. **Kernel-Level Monitoring**: Using eBPF to intercept system calls during build processes, providing visibility into every file access operation
2. **Real-Time Hash Computation**: Computing cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) of all accessed files to create unique identifiers
3. **Merkle Tree Construction**: Organizing file hashes into a tamper-evident Merkle tree structure
4. **Comprehensive SBOM Generation**: Creating SBOMs that include dynamically loaded dependencies, conditional compilation artifacts, and ephemeral build-time components

The key innovation of Bomfather is its ability to capture the *actual* dependencies used during compilation rather than just the *declared* dependencies. This approach solves several critical problems:

- Identifies unknown dependencies that traditional tools might miss
- Verifies which parts of declared dependencies are actually used
- Captures runtime-loaded libraries and plugins
- Documents build-time dependencies in containerized environments
- Creates cryptographic evidence of build provenance
