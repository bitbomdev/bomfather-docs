          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How does Bomfather differ from other dependency scanning tools?</h3>
          <p class="text-mid-gray">
            Unlike traditional tools that analyze package manifests, Bomfather monitors actual runtime behavior at the kernel level, providing a complete and accurate picture of all dependencies actually used during builds and execution.
