        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12">Our Story â€” Building Runtime Trust for AI ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          A critical red-team exercise revealed what others missed: attackers could silently swap model weights post-deployment without detection. While traditional security stops at code review, we discovered the real threats emerge during runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Bomfather was born from this revelation. Our proprietary technology leverages eBPF within the Linux kernel to create a Merkle tree security architecture that monitors, protects, and comprehensively logs every file access, GPU call, and system interaction in real-time. This cryptographic chain not only detects unauthorized changesâ€”to models, data, or librariesâ€”but actively protects against them while maintaining immutable records of all system activities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Currently in private beta with elite defense and autonomous-systems teams, Bomfather delivers tamper-proof runtime verification with minimal overhead (under 3%) and zero code modifications. Our partners rely on us when security compromises aren't acceptable and complete operational logging is essential.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Our mission: ensure every AI system operates with verifiable security throughout its entire lifecycleâ€”before deployment, during execution, and after completionâ€”with protection and logging that creates indisputable evidence of system integrity.
