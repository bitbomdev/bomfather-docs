        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          The Bomfather project was born out of the recognition that traditional dependency management tools were 
          insufficient for today's complex software supply chains. With the rise of supply chain attacks and increasing 
          regulatory requirements, we saw the need for a tool that could provide absolute truth about what dependencies 
          are actually used during builds.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          By leveraging eBPF to monitor system calls at the kernel level, Bomfather captures all file access 
          events during the build process, creating a cryptographically verifiable record of every dependency â€” including 
          those that are dynamically loaded, pulled from caches, or otherwise hidden from traditional manifest-based tools.
        </p>

          <p class="text-lg italic">
            "We built Bomfather to solve the fundamental problem of dependency tracking: the gap between what's declared 
            and what's actually used."
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Today, Bomfather is an open-source project dedicated to enhancing software supply chain security through 
          accurate, comprehensive dependency tracking.
